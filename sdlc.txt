Published Nov 18, 2025
Software development lifecycle events are used to describe various stages throughout the lifecycle of a software component.

Such events can include, but are not limited to

CI/CD pipeline events
Task events emitted from a CI/CD pipeline
Task events occurring outside a CI/CD pipeline
Software development lifecycle events are mainly composed of the following namespaces

Artifact (artifact.* namespace)
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (cicd.* namespace)
Deployment Attributes (deployment.* namespace)
VCS Repository (vcs.* namespace)

SDLC validation events
The SDLC validation events are generated when a validation is started or finished. This can happen in the context of a CI/CD system.

Query
Get all SDLC validation task events.

fetch events
| filter event.kind == "SDLC_EVENT" and event.category == "task" and event.type == "validation"

Get all SDLC validation started task events.

fetch events
| filter event.kind == "SDLC_EVENT" and event.category == "task" and event.type == "validation" and event.status == "started"

Get all SDLC validation finished task events.

fetch events
| filter event.kind == "SDLC_EVENT" and event.category == "task" and event.type == "validation" and event.status == "finished"

Common attributes
The common attributes listed in this section apply to both started and finished events, in addition to the specific attributes listed in the validation started and validation finished sections below.

For all validation events, event.kind must be SDLC_EVENT, event.category must be task, and event.type must be validation.

Attribute	Type	Description	Examples
cicd.pipeline.id	string	experimental
The cicd.pipeline.id if the validation was triggered in the context of a CI/CD pipeline. Value is optional.	12345
cicd.pipeline.run.id	string	experimental
The cicd.pipeline.run.id if the validation was triggered in the context of a CI/CD pipeline. Value is optional.	9876
event.category	string	experimental
Describes the SDLC event's category, which must be set to task for SDLC validation events.	task
event.description	string	experimental
Value is optional.	This is a validation finished event
event.id	string	experimental
Unique identifier string of an event; is stable across multiple refreshes and updates.	5547782627070661074_1647601320000
event.kind	string	experimental
Gives high-level information about what kind of information the event contains without being specific about the contents of the event. It helps to determine the record type of a raw event. 1
Tags: permission	SDLC_EVENT
event.name	string	experimental
Value is optional.	Validation finished
event.provider	string	experimental
Source of the event, for example, the name of the component or system that generated the event.
Tags: permission	dynatrace.site.reliability.guardian
event.status	string	experimental
The value must either be set to started for SDLC validation started task events or to finished for SDLC validation finished task events.	finished; started
event.type	string	experimental
The value must be set to validation for any task event describing a validation in the Software Development Life Cycle.
Tags: permission	validation
event.version	string	experimental
Describes the version of the event.	0.0.1
start_time	timestamp	experimental
The start time of the validation process. Value is optional.	1649822520123123123
task.id	string	experimental
Value is optional.	123
task.name	string	experimental
Value is optional.	Validation for service-A during CI run of pipeline-B
task.outcome	string	experimental
Value is optional.	Success; Warning; Failure; Error; Skipped; Canceled; TimedOut; NotApplicable
timestamp	timestamp	experimental
The time (UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds) when the event originated, typically when the source created it. If no original timestamp is available, it will be populated at ingest time and required for all events. In the case of a correlated event (for example, ITIL events), this time could be different from the event.start time, as this time represents the actual timestamp when the "update" for the event was created.	1649822520123123123
validation.from	string	experimental
An ISO 8601 compliant timestamp identifying the start of the validation timeframe. Value is optional. 2	2024-10-09T20:00:12.199Z
validation.to	string	experimental
An ISO 8601 compliant timestamp identifying the end of the validation timeframe. Value is optional. 3	2024-10-09T20:10:12.199Z
1
Automatically and unconditionally set to value SDLC_EVENT.

2
This is not the start of the validation process, but the start of the timeframe if the underlying validation logic is timeframe-based, as would be the case for metrics.

3
This is not the end of the validation process, but the end of the timeframe if the underlying validation logic is timeframe-based, as would be the case for metrics.

Validation started
This event type represents an SDLC validation started event.

For a validation started event, event.status must be started.

Attribute	Type	Description	Examples
event.status	string	experimental
The value must be set to started for SDLC validation started task events.	started
Validation finished
This event type represents an SDLC validation finished event.

For a validation finished event, event.status must be finished.

Attribute	Type	Description	Examples
duration	duration	experimental
The duration of the validation process. This should be the time span between start_time and end_time. Value is optional.	42
end_time	timestamp	experimental
The end time of the validation process. Value is optional.	1649822520123123165
event.status	string	experimental
The value must be set to finished for SDLC validation finished task events.	finished
validation.at	string	experimental
An ISO 8601 compliant timestamp identifying the time when the validation process happened. Should be used to specify the timestamp when data had been retrieved, if the underlying validation logic would depend on that. In general, this timestamp should be greater than or equal to start_time and less than or equal to end_time. Value is optional. 1	2024-10-09T20:10:12.199Z
validation.result	string	experimental
A text indicating the status of the finished validation.	pass; warning; fail; info; error
1
This timestamp or the timeframe determined by validation.to and validation.from should be set, depending on the use case. If there is no time-based component at all in the context of this validation, then all three fields are optional. Conversely, if the timeframe-based validation logic depends on data that might be sampled, then all three fields could be set.
